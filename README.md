# Diary Maker

This is a simple Python script to create a diary in the user's Documents directory, each entry is saved as a text file with the file name of the current time in `%H%M%S` format is stored in a subdirectory named as today's date in the format of `%Y-%m-%d`.

There is also `diary convert.py` if you would like to convert your diary/journal from the DayOne software (iOS/macOS). You need to export it as JSON and not plain text.
